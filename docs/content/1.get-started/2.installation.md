# Installation

Get started quickly by installing and setting up this module with the following instructions.

## Prerequisites

- A fresh or existing Nuxt project
- [Nuxt's prerequisites](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/installation#prerequisites)
- [Ionic's environment setup](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/environment)
- [Capacitor's enviroment setup](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/getting-started/environment-setup) if using iOS or Android

## Installation

Add `@nuxtjs/ionic` to your project's dev dependencies:

::code-group

```bash [yarn]
yarn add --dev @nuxtjs/ionic
```

```bash [npm]
npm install @nuxtjs/ionic -D
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm install @nuxtjs/ionic -D
```

::

### Nuxt Module

Next, add the module to your Nuxt configuration in `nuxt.config.ts`.

```js{}[nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@nuxtjs/ionic'],
  ssr: false,
})
```

::alert{type="warning"}
If deploying to iOS or Android, be aware the app must be able to run completely client-side. We recommend setting `ssr: false` in your nuxt config. Find out more in [deploying to both web and device](/cookbook/web-and-device).
::

Finally, either remove your `app.vue` file or [replace it with a custom one](/cookbook/customising-app-vue).

### Development Server

Now you'll be able to start your Nuxt app in development mode as usual:

::code-group

```bash [yarn]
yarn dev -o
```

```bash [npm]
npm run dev -- -o
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm dev -o
```

::

::alert{type=success icon=âœ¨ .font-bold}
Well done! A browser window should automatically open for <http://localhost:3000>.
::

::alert{type=info}
The first time you start a Nuxt project with `@nuxtjs/ionic` enabled, a `ionic.config.json` file will be created if it doesn't already exist.
