Live Updates, also known as Over-the-Air (OTA) or hot code updates, are a way to push updates to your Android or iOS app without going through the app store review process. This is particularly useful for bug fixes or minor updates that don't require a full app release. 

There are several providers that offer live update services, including:
- [Capawesome Cloud](https://cloud.capawesome.io/)
- [CodePush (standalone)](https://github.com/microsoft/code-push-server)

## Capawesome Cloud

This guide demonstrates how to implement live updates using Capawesome Cloud.

### Installation

To enable Live Updates with Capawesome Cloud, you need to install the `@capawesome/capacitor-live-update` plugin:

```bash
npm install --save @capawesome/capacitor-live-update
```

After that, you need to sync the changes with your native projects:

```bash
npx cap sync
```

### Configuration

Next, you need to configure the plugin to work with [Capawesome Cloud](https://cloud.capawesome.io/).

#### App ID

In order for your app to identify itself to Capawesome Cloud, you need to set the `appId` in your `capacitor.config` file. For this, you need to create an app on the [Capawesome Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.capawesome.io/) and get the App ID.

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "LiveUpdate": {
      "appId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` with your actual App ID from the Capawesome Cloud Console.

After configuring the App ID, sync your Capacitor project again:

```bash
npx cap sync
```

### Usage

The most basic usage of the Live Update plugin is to call the [`sync(...)`](https://capawesome.io/plugins/live-update/#sync) method when the app starts. This method checks for updates, downloads them if available, and sets them as the next bundle to be applied. You can then call the [`reload()`](https://capawesome.io/plugins/live-update/#reload) method to apply the update immediately. If the [`reload()`](https://capawesome.io/plugins/live-update/#reload) method is not called, the new bundle will be used on the next app start.

```js
import { LiveUpdate } from "@capawesome/capacitor-live-update"

const sync = async () => {
  const result = await LiveUpdate.sync()
  if (result.nextBundleId) {
    await LiveUpdate.reload()
  }
}
```

### Publishing updates

To publish your first update, you need to [create a bundle](https://capawesome.io/cloud/live-updates/bundles/#create-a-bundle) on Capawesome Cloud. For this, you need a bundle artifact. A bundle artifact is the build output of your web app. In Nuxt, this is the `dist` folder. You can create a bundle artifact by running the following command:

#### Building your app

Generate the production build of your Nuxt app:

```bash
npx nuxt generate
```

This creates a `dist` folder with the build output of your web app.

#### Publishing with Capawesome CLI

To install the Capawesome CLI,run the following command:

```bash
npm i -g @capawesome/cli
```

After installing the Capawesome CLI, you need to log in to your Capawesome Cloud account. Run the following command and follow the instructions:

```bash
npx capawesome login
```

Once you are logged in, you can create a bundle by running the following command:

```bash
npx capawesome apps:bundles:create --path dist
```

Congratulations! You have successfully published your first live update. You can now test it by running your app on a device or emulator. The app will check for updates and apply them if available.
Feel free to check out the [documentation](https://capawesome.io/plugins/live-update/) of the Live Update plugin to see what else you can do with it.
