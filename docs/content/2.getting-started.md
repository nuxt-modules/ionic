## Installation

Add `nuxt-ionic` to your project's dev dependencies:

::code-group

```bash [yarn]
yarn add --dev nuxt-ionic
```

```bash [npm]
npm install nuxt-ionic -D
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm install nuxt-ionic -D
```

::

Then add the module to your Nuxt configuration:

```js{}[nuxt.config]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['nuxt-ionic']
})
```

Finally, either remove your `app.vue` file or replace it with a custom one (starting with [this template](/features#advanced)).

You're good to go!

::alert{type=info}
The first time you start a Nuxt project with `nuxt-ionic` enabled, a `ionic.config.json` file will be created if it doesn't already exist.

## Enabling Capacitor

[Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) is a powerful tool for shipping to native platforms like iOS and Android alongside your web app.

The good news is that it's installed by default with `nuxt-ionic`, but you will need to enable it and choose what platforms you want to support.

```bash
npx @ionic/cli integrations enable capacitor # or yarn ionic integrations add capacitor
npx cap add ios # or yarn cap add ios
npx cap add android # or yarn cap add android
```

::alert
After building your Nuxt app with `npx nuxi generate`, you will need to run `npx cap sync` to update your Capacitor project directories with your latest app build.
