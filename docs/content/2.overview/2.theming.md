# Theming

Ionic provides many css variables with which their components derive css styles. These variables can be overridden to customise the theme of your app. 

In its most simple form, you can create a `~/assets/css/ionic.css` file and add it to the `css` property in your `nuxt.config.ts` file. You can then add css variables that you'd like to override within this file, under the `:root` selector:

::code-group

```css [assets/css/ionic.css]
:root {
  --ion-color-primary: #57e389;
  --ion-color-primary-rgb: 87, 227, 137;
  --ion-color-primary-contrast: #000000;
  --ion-color-primary-contrast-rgb: 0, 0, 0;
  --ion-color-primary-shade: #4dc879;
  --ion-color-primary-tint: #68e695;

  /* And so on... */
}
```

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  css: ['~/assets/css/ionic.css'],
})
```
