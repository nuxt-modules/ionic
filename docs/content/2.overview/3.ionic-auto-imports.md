# Ionic Auto-Imports

Ionic provides various components and helper functions for use in your application.

This module automatically auto-imports them throughout your app, so you do not need to import them manually.

Read more about [how component auto-imports work](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/directory-structure/components#components-directory).

## Ionic Components

All Ionic Vue components should be auto-imported throughout your app. Although your IDE should be aware of these components everywhere, they are not globally registered and are only imported within the components that use them.

For a list of all Ionic Vue components, please refer to the ionic component documentation: https://ionicframework.com/docs/components

::alert{type="info"}
If you find a component that isn't being auto-imported, please [open an issue](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/ionic/issues/new/choose) or [a pull request](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/ionic/compare).
